CodeRoulette
============

Spin the wheel, review some code!

### A Shoes App

Relies on Shoes Policeman. I built it from the source at [github/shoes/shoes](http://www.github.com/shoes/shoes). You may have other ways of acquiring your own pair of shoes.

Only tested in linux so far!

### Running

Plenty of work to be done cleaning up the packaging here, but these might work:

    shoes dist/coderoulette.shy

or in linux:

    sh dist/coderoulette.run

### Screenshot

Here's what it looks like:
